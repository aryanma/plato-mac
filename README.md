## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Download the latest release assets from [Releases](https://github.com/aryanma/plato-mac/releases):**
    - `plato-mac` (the main app binary)
    - `bin/terminal-notifier`
    - `vosk-model.zip`

2. **Unzip the Vosk model:**
    ```sh
    unzip vosk-model.zip -d vosk/model/
    ```
    After unzipping, your folder structure should look like:
    ```
    vosk/model/am/
    vosk/model/conf/
    vosk/model/graph/
    vosk/model/ivector/
    ```

3. **Place `terminal-notifier` in the correct location:**
    - Move `terminal-notifier` into the `bin/` directory in your project root.
    - If the `bin/` directory does not exist, create it:
      ```sh
      mkdir -p bin
      mv terminal-notifier bin/
      ```

4. **Make the binary executable:**
    ```sh
    chmod +x plato-mac
    ```

5. **Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google credentials:**
    ```
    CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
    ```

6. **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    ./plato-mac
    ```
    - On first run, your browser will open for Google login/consent. Approve access.
